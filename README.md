# Rediskets app

This is a project to generate content for social media. To start just type the key words and then the format, list, bullet points, ranking, max number of characters. It is going to create the post and the hashtags associated with it.

Example:

`web3 market problems list in 250 characters`

Then the result is going to be something like:
`Web3 markets suffer from high transaction fees, low liquidity, scalability issues, limited access to finance and a lack of user-friendly interfaces. #web3 #market #transactionfees #liquidity #scalability`

## Run the app

```bash
$ npm run dev
```

You should now be able to access the app at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)!
